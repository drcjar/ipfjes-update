##

Incidence of IPF has been rising; several reasons to think might be related to occupational exposures and asbestos in particular.

## 

IPFJES is a hospital based case-control study designed to address limitations of previous studies and definitively characterise occupational
determinants of IPF (if there are any).

##

Hospital based case-control studies of disease aetiology are hard.

##

We've recruited 488 cases and 359 controls from 21 centres so far. Average participant is a male, caucasian, 75 year old ex-smoker with a 20 pack-year history, with a history of work in lower supervisory and technical occupations (social class group 5). 

## 

65% of cases and 63% of controls ever had a medium or high risk job.
